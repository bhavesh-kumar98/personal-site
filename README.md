# HTML Learning Repository

Welcome to my HTML Learning Repository! 🌐

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning HTML, exploring various tags, and understanding how to create web pages. I've structured my learning process by using different branches for each topic, and I'll share the steps below.

## Branches and Topics

### 1. [html-basics](#)
   I've covered the fundamental HTML tags, including `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<br>`, and more. Explore the commits to see my progress in understanding these tags.

### 2. [linking-pages](#)
    I learned how to link HTML pages together using `<a>` (anchor) tags. I've explored both relative and absolute paths for linking pages.

### 3. [git-setup](#)
   This branch documents how I set up Git and GitHub for version control. It covers initializing a repository, making commits, creating branches, and pushing changes to a remote repository on GitHub.

## Merging into Main

I will merge each branch into the `main` branch to consolidate my learning. Feel free to review the commit history and explore the changes made in each branch.

Happy coding and learning! 📚👩‍💻
